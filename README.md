# rvtpo

This is the travel demand model for the Roanoke, Virginia region. The model is
developed largely in Cube 6.2, with some submodules executed in R. The model
includes an installation of R, and no additional software (beyond Cube) is
necessary to run the model.

The model user's guide is available on the [rvtpo wiki](https://github.com/pbsag/rvtpo/wiki)
